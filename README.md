Screen capture is an end-to-end open source platform for computer monitor surveillance. It has a complete and easy-to-use set of parameters that can be adjusted for the personal needs of the user. 

Screen capture was originally developed to help family members retain accountability for what content they are viewing on the computer when otherwise unsupervised. The system is
versatile enough to be applicable in other use cases as well.
